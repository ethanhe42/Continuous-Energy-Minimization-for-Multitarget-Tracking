Continuous Energy Minimization for Multitarget Tracking
=======================================================
Anton Milan and Stefan Roth and Konrad Schindler
------------------------------------------------




About
=====

This software implements our approach to multi-target tracking
using continuous energy minimization [1,2,3].

The additional package

    minimize.m
 
is released under a different license and is included for your convenience.




Important:
==========
This software has been refactored for the sake of simplifying the
implementation. Therefore, the results produced by the code may differ
from those presented in the papers [1,2,3].

Installation
============
This section describes how to get cemtracking running under Linux.
Open a terminal window.

Get the code

    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/amilan/contracking    
    
### MOT utils
This package includes many useful functions for reading detections, displaying results, etc.
    
    hg clone https://bitbucket.org/amilan/motutils
    cd contracking
    

Start MATLAB and run `compileMex.m` to build the utilities binaries.


Running
=======

run `cemTrackerDemo.m`
